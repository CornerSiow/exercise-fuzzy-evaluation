# Exercise Fuzzy Evaluation
Use a fuzzy system evaluate a simple exercise.

The process:
1) Extract the skeleon poses from the video.
2) Obtains the essential poses from these skeleton poses.
3) Create the fuzzy memberships based on these essential poses.
4) Create a temporal fuzzy transition memberships based on these essential poese.
5) Perform defuzzification into the evaluation score.

The details of the algorithm can found in this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MHAPZS9x6fQCE3g68yHw6ZAo7Cj6bCMD?usp=sharing">colab</a> link.
